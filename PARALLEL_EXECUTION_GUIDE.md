# 🚀 Claudook Parallel Task Orchestration System

## Overview

The Parallel Task Orchestration System is an advanced feature of Claudook that automatically decomposes complex requests into subtasks, identifies which tasks can run in parallel, and orchestrates their execution using specialized agents.

## Architecture

## Key Components

### 1. Task Orchestrator
The main brain that intercepts user prompts and orchestrates the entire process.

### 2. Task Analyzer
Analyzes request complexity and breaks it down into atomic, manageable subtasks.

### 3. Dependency Analyzer
Builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to understand task dependencies and identify parallelizable groups.

### 4. Agent Spawner
Creates specialized agents for different task types:
- **Researcher**: Gathers information, analyzes existing code
- **Architect**: Designs systems, creates schemas
- **Coder**: Implements features, writes code
- **Tester**: Creates and runs tests
- **Documenter**: Writes documentation

### 5. Parallel Executor
Manages concurrent execution of independent tasks while respecting dependencies.

### 6. Result Merger
Combines outputs from multiple agents into a cohesive result.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Request Analysis
When you submit a request like "Build a REST API with authentication", the system:
1. Detects complexity level
2. Identifies task type (API development)
3. Estimates time and resources needed

### Step 2: Task Decomposition
The request is broken down into subtasks:
```
1. Research authentication methods
2. Design API structure
3. Create database schema
4. Implement user model
5. Build registration endpoint
6. Build login endpoint
7. Add JWT token generation
8. Create tests
9. Write documentation
```

### Step 3: Dependency Analysis
The system identifies dependencies:
```
Research ─┐
          ├─→ Implementation ─→ Testing
Design ───┘

Documentation (independent, can run parallel)
```

### Step 4: Parallel Grouping
Tasks are grouped for parallel execution:
- **Group 1** (Parallel): Research, Design, Documentation planning
- **Group 2** (Sequential): Implementation (depends on 1)
- **Group 3** (Sequential): Testing (depends on 2)

### Step 5: Agent Assignment
Specialized agents are assigned:
- Research → Researcher Agent
- Design → Architect Agent
- Implementation → Coder Agent
- Testing → Tester Agent
- Documentation → Documenter Agent

### Step 6: Execution
Agents work concurrently where possible:
```
Time 0-5min:  [Researcher] [Architect] [Documenter]
Time 5-15min: [Coder-Backend] [Coder-Frontend]
Time 15-20min:[Tester]
```

### Step 7: Result Merging
All agent outputs are combined into a final deliverable.

## Example: Building an Authentication System

### Input
"Build a complete authentication system with user registration, login, JWT tokens, and password reset"

### Decomposition
```markdown
# Phase 1: Research & Planning (Parallel - 3 agents)
- Agent 1 (Researcher): Research auth best practices, JWT implementation
- Agent 2 (Architect): Design database schema, API structure
- Agent 3 (Documenter): Plan API documentation structure

# Phase 2: Implementation (Parallel - 2 agents)
- Agent 4 (Backend Coder): Implement auth endpoints, JWT logic
- Agent 5 (Frontend Coder): Create login/register forms

# Phase 3: Testing & Finalization (Sequential - 1 agent)
- Agent 6 (Tester): Write and run comprehensive tests
```

### Execution Timeline
```
[0-5 min]   ███ Research | ███ Design | ███ Doc Planning
[5-15 min]  ████████ Backend Implementation | ██████ Frontend
[15-20 min] █████ Testing & Validation
```

### Result
Complete authentication system with:
- ✅ User registration endpoint
- ✅ Login with JWT generation
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive tests
- ✅ API documentation

## Commands

### Enable/Disable Parallel Execution
```bash
/enable-parallel   # Turn on parallel task execution
/disable-parallel  # Turn off (sequential mode)
```

### Task Management
```bash
/task-status       # Show current task progress
/agent-status      # Show active agents
/task-reset        # Clear all tasks
```

### Manual Control
```bash
/task-complete 001 # Manually mark task as complete
/agent-spawn coder # Manually spawn an agent
```

## Configuration

### Parallel Execution Settings
```python
# .claude/config/parallel_config.json
{
  "max_parallel_agents": 5,
  "auto_parallelize": true,
  "complexity_threshold": "medium",
  "enable_progress_dashboard": true,
  "agent_timeout_minutes": 10
}
```

### Agent Specializations
```python
{
  "researcher": {
    "focus": ["analysis", "investigation", "research"],
    "tools": ["WebSearch", "Read", "Grep"],
    "parallel_safe": true
  },
  "coder": {
    "focus": ["implementation", "development"],
    "tools": ["Write", "Edit", "MultiEdit"],
    "parallel_safe": false  # Avoid file conflicts
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### Speed
- **3-5x faster** completion for complex projects
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Optimal resource utilization

### Quality
- **Specialized agents** for each task type
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Better documentation

### Clarity
- Visual progress tracking
- Clear task dependencies
- Predictable execution order

### Scalability
- Handles projects of any size
- Automatic task decomposition
- Smart resource management

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Running in Parallel
- Check if parallel execution is enabled: `/task-status`
- Verify no dependency conflicts
- Check agent limit hasn't been reached

### Agent Failures
- View agent logs: `.claude/tasks/logs/`
- Check for file conflicts
- Verify agent timeout settings

### Result Merging Issues
- Check for conflicting changes
- Review merge strategy in config
- Manually resolve in `.claude/tasks/outputs/`

## Best Practices

1. **Let the system analyze first** - Don't interrupt during decomposition
2. **Review the execution plan** - Check MASTER_TASKS.md before proceeding
3. **Monitor progress** - Use `/task-status` to track execution
4. **Trust agent specialization** - Each agent is optimized for their task type
5. **Allow sufficient time** - Complex tasks may take 10-20 minutes

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Types
Create your own specialized agents:
```python
# .claude/agents/custom_agent.py
class SecurityAuditor(BaseAgent):
    focus = ["security", "vulnerability", "audit"]
    tools = ["Grep", "Read", "SecurityScanner"]
```

### Task Templates
Pre-defined task breakdowns for common requests:
- API Development
- Frontend Application
- Database Migration
- Bug Fix
- Refactoring

### Dependency Overrides
Manually specify task dependencies:
```bash
/task-dependency 003 --depends-on 001,002
```

## Integration with TodoWrite

All tasks are automatically synchronized with TodoWrite:
- Real-time progress updates
- Visual progress bars
- Automatic completion tracking
- Task history

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-powered dependency detection**
- **Cross-project task reuse**
- **Agent learning and improvement**
- **Distributed execution across multiple machines**
- **Real-time collaboration between agents**
