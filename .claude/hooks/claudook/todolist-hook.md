# Claudook Fixes Documentation

## 1. Task Orchestration Fix - Empty Session Folders

### Problem Identified
The Claudook task orchestration system was creating empty session folders at `.claude/tasks/session_*` because:
1. Files were being written to the main `.claude/tasks/` directory instead of session folders
2. The agent_spawner.py module existed but was never integrated into the workflow
3. No individual task files or agent configurations were being created

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated File Structure
Modified task_orchestrator.py to create a proper session folder structure:
```
.claude/tasks/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── MASTER_TASKS.md         # Overall task plan
├── EXECUTION_DASHBOARD.md  # Live status tracking
├── tasks/                  # Individual task files
│   ├── task_001.md
│   ├── task_002.md
│   └── ...
├── agents/                 # Agent configurations
│   ├── agent_*.json
│   └── AGENT_SUMMARY.md
└── outputs/               # Task outputs (to be generated)
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### task_orchestrator.py
- Modified `create_master_tasks_file()` to write to session folder
- Modified `create_execution_dashboard()` to write to session folder
- Added `create_individual_task_files()` method to create task files
- Added `create_agent_configs()` method to integrate agent spawner
- Created symlinks in main directory for backwards compatibility

#### agent_spawner.py
- Integrated into task orchestrator workflow
- Creates agent configurations for each task
- Saves configurations in session-specific folders

### 3. Testing Results
✅ All tests passed successfully:
- Session folders are created with proper structure
- Individual task files are generated (10 files created)
- Agent configurations are created (11 files created)
- MASTER_TASKS.md and EXECUTION_DASHBOARD.md are in session folder
- Symlinks maintain backwards compatibility

## Files Modified
1. `.claude/hooks/claudook/task_orchestrator.py` - Updated to write files to session folders
2. `.claude/hooks/claudook/agent_spawner.py` - Copied and integrated

## How It Works Now
When a user prompt triggers the task orchestrator:
1. A new session folder is created with timestamp
2. Tasks are decomposed and individual task files are created
3. Agent configurations are generated for each task
4. All files are properly organized in the session folder
5. The system is ready for parallel task execution

## Usage
The updated system will automatically organize tasks in session folders whenever the task orchestrator is triggered by user prompts that meet the complexity threshold.

Each session maintains a complete record of:
- What tasks were planned
- Which agents were assigned
- Task execution status
- Generated outputs

This fix ensures proper task tracking and organization for the Claudook task orchestration system.

## 2. Hook Path Resolution Fix - Working Directory Issues

### Problem Identified
When working in subdirectories (e.g., `backend/`), Claudook hooks failed with:
```
can't open file '.claude/hooks/claudook/[script].py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

The hooks were using relative paths that broke when Claude changed directories.

### Solution Implemented
Updated hook commands in `.claude/settings.json` to always run from the git repository root:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)" && python3 .claude/hooks/claudook/[script].py
```

This ensures hooks can find their files regardless of the current working directory.

## 3. Global Settings Permission Syntax Fix

### Problem Identified
Invalid permission syntax in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
- `Bash(*)` - incorrect wildcard syntax
- `WebFetch(*)` - missing domain: prefix
- `WebSearch(*)` - doesn't support wildcards

### Solution Implemented
Fixed permissions to use correct syntax:
- `Bash` - allows all bash commands
- `WebFetch` - allows all domains
- `WebSearch` - allows all searches

## Summary
All Claudook issues have been resolved:
✅ Session folders now properly populated with task files
✅ Hooks work correctly from any subdirectory
✅ Global settings permissions are valid
