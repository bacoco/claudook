# Enable Multiple Choices

Activate the automatic A/B/C option system for complex questions.

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/claudook/toggle_controls.py enable-choices
```

This will make Claude automatically offer three options (A/B/C) whenever a question could have multiple valid approaches, helping you choose the best solution before implementation.
